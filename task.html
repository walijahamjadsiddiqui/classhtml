<h2><b><center>HUMAN PERSONALITY</center></b></h2>
<p><center>The concept of personality has different meanings and in psychology, has been defined in many ways. The study of personalities is as important to psychology as studying thoughts, emotions, and behavior. The study of human behavior requires that researchers observe and report the behavior appropriately so that they can explain as to why the person behaved in such a way as have been observed.The goal of personality research is to understand the basics of personality traits and to determine if individual traits can be grouped in categories. Other questions personality theorist try to answer is how personality traits develop, and what roles do biological and environmental influences affect the individual’s personality. As with the studies of behavior, researchers experiment to develop new theories about personality.Actually, Personality is defined as the character sets of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors. While there is no generally 
aged-upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with one’s environment. Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by Raymond Cattell, define personality as the traits that predict a person’s behavior. On the other hand, more behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable.</center></P>
